Getting Started
===============

Project 2 Concat Primes

This program consists of tests and the physical program itself which can be repeated as many times as the user wants.


Installation and RUN

Navigate to the file so when you type an ls command the internal files are shown.

First, Type doxygen into the prompt.

Then, Type make.

Then, Type make test, to check for passing the five test cases.

Next, use cd bin to navigate to the bin directory.  

(There is a binary file called "concat" in this location.)  

Once in the bin directory, use the command: concat to compile the program and run it. 

You can also use the command ./bin/concat to run the program and skip changing the directory to bin.

Ctrl +C is used to stop the program.
